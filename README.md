### Antanha's eternal magic trees

Chops down eternal magic trees.

### Instructions

Requires War's Retreat teleport to be unlocked or that you have Ring of Fortune or Luck of the Dwarves equipped.

It'll pick bird's nests up, and it'll use decorated urns and/or wood box if you leave them in your inventory.

If you have a normal and/or perfect juju woodcutting potion when starting the script, it will use it and withdraw more if needed the next time it banks.

Make sure your backpack and magic (if using War's Retreat teleport) or equipment (if using Ring of Fortune or Luck of the Dwarves) menus are open, then start the script.
